The classification of social media ads is all about examining the ads to determine whether or not your target market will purchase the product. It's an excellent application of data science to marketing.

Classification of Social Media Ads :

In order to categorise  social media advertisements, you must first analyse your social media campaigns to identify the most lucrative and likely to purchase clients. When it comes to age and income, a product you're selling isn't always ideal for everyone. An individual between the ages of 20 and 25 might prefer to spend more money on smartphone covers than an individual between the ages of 40 and 45.
A high earner can afford to spend more money on luxury items than a person with a low income. So, by categorising their social media adverts, a company may ascertain if a customer would purchase their goods or not. I'll walk you through classifying social media ads with Python and machine learning in the section below.

Python-based Social Media Ads Classification :

I acquired the dataset from Kaggle to use for the Social Media Ads Classification challenge. It has information regarding a product's social media marketing effort. It includes elements such as:
 1. the target audience's age
2. the target audience's expected wage
3. and whether or not the target market has bought the product.
